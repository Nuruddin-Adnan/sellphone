                            <p>
                                When we talk about state in our applications, itâ€™s important to be clear about what types of state actually matter.
                                <br /><br />
                                There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in your React apps:

                                <li> Local state </li>
                                <li> Global state </li>
                                <li> Server state </li>
                                <li> URL state</li>

                            <p>
                                The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype. Note: The property of an object that points to its prototype is not called prototype .

                            <p><strong>Unit Testing</strong></p>
                            <p>Unit testing is testing the smallest testable unit of an application. It is done during the coding phase by the developers. To perform unit testing, a developer writes a piece of code (unit tests) to verify the code to be tested (unit) is correct.</p>

                            <p><strong>Why should we write unit tests</strong></p>
                            <p> Developers write unit tests for their code <strong>to make sure that the code works correctly</strong>. This helps to detect and protect against bugs in the future. Sometimes developers write unit tests first, then write the code. This approach is also known as test-driven development (TDD) </p>
